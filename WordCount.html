This is now the reality of <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />Now, I am hopeful that the <strong>Iraq</strong> Study Group emerges next month with a series of proposals around which we can begin to build a bipartisan consensus<br /><br />And so the question is not whether there is some magic formula for success, or guarantee against failure, in <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />Rather, the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in <strong>Iraq</strong>, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security<br /><br />What is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the President to respond to <strong>Iraq</strong>’s reality by saying that he is “open to” or “interested in” new ideas while acting as if all that’s required is doing more of the same<br /><br />It may be politically advantageous for the President to simply define victory as staying and defeat as leaving, but it prevents a serious conversation about the realistic objectives we can still achieve in <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />We must instead turn our focus to those concrete objectives that are possible to attain ? namely, preventing <strong>Iraq</strong> from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home<br /><br />There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />The American soldiers I met when I traveled to <strong>Iraq</strong> this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question<br /><br />They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />I have long said that the only solution in <strong>Iraq</strong> is a political one<br /><br />To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in <strong>Iraq</strong> that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end<br /><br />troops from <strong>Iraq</strong> on a timetable that would begin in four to six months<br /><br />is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ? that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in <strong>Iraq</strong> reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels<br /><br />Drawing down our troops in <strong>Iraq</strong> will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern <strong>Iraq</strong> and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force<br /><br />This force could help prevent the conflict in <strong>Iraq</strong> from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern <strong>Iraq</strong>, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region<br /><br />The President’s decision to go to war in <strong>Iraq</strong> has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control<br /><br />By redeploying from <strong>Iraq</strong> to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism<br /><br />troops remaining in <strong>Iraq</strong> should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists<br /><br />force might remain in <strong>Iraq</strong> for a more extended period of time<br /><br />We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in <strong>Iraq</strong>, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the <strong>Iraq</strong>i state and further polarization of <strong>Iraq</strong>i society<br /><br />strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in <strong>Iraq</strong> to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified <strong>Iraq</strong>i government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U<br /><br />The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in <strong>Iraq</strong> with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement<br /><br />So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of <strong>Iraq</strong>, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution<br /><br />But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in <strong>Iraq</strong> filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ? and within their own countries<br /><br />The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of <strong>Iraq</strong>, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various <strong>Iraq</strong>i factions towards a political solution<br /><br />Make no mistake ? if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use <strong>Iraq</strong> as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken<br /><br />As we change strategy in <strong>Iraq</strong>, we should also think about what <strong>Iraq</strong> has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism<br /><br />Many who supported the original decision to go to war in <strong>Iraq</strong> have argued that it has been a failure of implementation<br /><br />Much has been written about how the military invasion of <strong>Iraq</strong> was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell<br /><br />We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ? threats we haven’t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in <strong>Iraq</strong> than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism<br /><br />The overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in <strong>Iraq</strong> has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world<br /><br />There is one other place where our mistakes in <strong>Iraq</strong> have cost us dearly ? and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the American people<br /><br />But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in <strong>Iraq</strong> and the policy that has characterized our time there ? a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality<br /><br />I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about <strong>Iraq</strong> that was similar to the one I did today<br /><br />The time for waiting in <strong>Iraq</strong> is over<br /><br />Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from <strong>Iraq</strong> and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill<br /><br />For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to <strong>Iraq</strong> just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face<br /><br />And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from <strong>Iraq</strong> has been echoed by the <strong>Iraq</strong>i government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that <strong>Iraq</strong> has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war<br /><br />You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />I will end this war in <strong>Iraq</strong> responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan<br /><br />And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in <strong>Iraq</strong> mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault<br /><br />But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in <strong>Iraq</strong><br /><br />We've seen our children leave for <strong>Iraq</strong> and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11<br /><br />That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in <strong>Iraq</strong>, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</td></tr><tr><td width='20%' valign='top'>America(54)</td><td width='10%' valign='top'>doc5.txt, doc4.txt, doc2.txt, doc1.txt, doc3.txt</td><td width='70%'>A few Tuesdays ago, the <strong>America</strong>n people embraced this seriousness with regards to <strong>America</strong>’s policy in Iraq<br /><br />And a report by our own intelligence agencies has concluded that al Qaeda is successfully using the war in Iraq to recruit a new generation of terrorists for its war on <strong>America</strong><br /><br />As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about <strong>America</strong>’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism<br /><br />We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats <strong>America</strong> now faces ?

a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful<br /><br />A few Tuesdays ago, the <strong>American</strong> people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq<br /><br />And now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in Washington, the <strong>American</strong> people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over<br /><br />“Mission Accomplished,” “cut and run,” “stay the course” ? the <strong>American</strong> people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ? a conflict that has only increased the terrorist threat it was supposed to help contain<br /><br />Iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before <strong>American</strong> troops arrived<br /><br />When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of <strong>American</strong> troops from Iraqi soil<br /><br />300,000 Iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet <strong>American</strong> troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier<br /><br />The addition of 4,000 <strong>American</strong> troops in Baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city<br /><br />And polls show that almost two-thirds of all Iraqis now sympathize with attacks on <strong>American</strong> soldiers<br /><br />In just the past three weeks, he has ? and I’m quoting from a New York Times article here ? “rejected the notion of an <strong>American</strong> ‘timeline’ for action on urgent Iraqi political issues; ordered <strong>American</strong> commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the Shiite district of Sadr City to hunt for a kidnapped <strong>American</strong> soldier and a fugitive Shiite death squad leader; and blamed the <strong>American</strong>s for the deteriorating security situation in Iraq<br /><br />And it is not enough for the President to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of <strong>American</strong> resolve<br /><br />The <strong>American</strong> people have been extraordinarily resolved<br /><br />It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding <strong>American</strong> forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own<br /><br />The <strong>American</strong> soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question<br /><br />commanders believe that a further reduction would put <strong>American</strong> troops in danger<br /><br />troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and <strong>American</strong> enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists<br /><br />But instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in <strong>American</strong> history<br /><br />There is one other place where our mistakes in Iraq have cost us dearly ? and that is the loss of our government’s credibility with the <strong>American</strong> people<br /><br />But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at <strong>American</strong> University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union<br /><br />My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in <strong>American</strong> history, from patronage machines to questionable elections<br /><br />It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one <strong>American</strong> family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well<br /><br />We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the <strong>American</strong> promise has been threatened once more<br /><br />We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major <strong>American</strong> city drowns before our eyes<br /><br />Tonight, I say to the <strong>American</strong> people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the <strong>American</strong> promise alive<br /><br />We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average <strong>American</strong> family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush<br /><br />It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create <strong>American</strong> jobs, look out for <strong>American</strong> workers, and play by the rules of the road<br /><br />It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every <strong>American</strong> who's willing to work<br /><br />Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the <strong>American</strong> workers and small businesses who deserve it<br /><br />I'll make it easier for the <strong>American</strong> people to afford these new cars<br /><br />And we will keep our promise to every young <strong>American</strong> - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education<br /><br />Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single <strong>American</strong><br /><br />Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts <strong>American</strong> wages by hiring illegal workers<br /><br />Change happens because the <strong>American</strong> people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time<br /><br />Instead, it is that <strong>American</strong> spirit - that <strong>American</strong> promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend<br /><br />Let us keep that promise - that <strong>American</strong> promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess<br /><br />It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the <strong>American</strong> people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America<br /><br />It's time to admit that no amount of <strong>American</strong> lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war<br /><br />And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-<strong>American</strong> woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life<br /><br />Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the <strong>American</strong> Dream<br /><br />That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every <strong>American</strong> an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training<br /><br />And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the <strong>American</strong> people about why we are there and how we will win<br /><br />If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an <strong>American</strong> agenda<br /><br />Our time to write a new chapter in the <strong>American</strong> story</td></tr><tr><td width='20%' valign='top'>Government(46)</td><td width='10%' valign='top'>doc5.txt, doc6.txt, doc4.txt, doc2.txt, doc1.txt, doc3.txt</td><td width='70%'>Dreams of democracy and hopes for a perfect <strong>Government</strong> are now just that ? dreams and hopes<br /><br />The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi <strong>Government</strong> ? a phased redeployment of U<br /><br />is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ? that it will be up to them to form a viable <strong>Government</strong> that can effectively run and secure Iraq<br /><br />When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi <strong>Government</strong> ? but it should not depend on Iraqi approval<br /><br />Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai <strong>Government</strong>, we are backsliding towards chaos<br /><br />commanders think such a force would be effective;

It's not because John McCain doesn't care<br /><br />The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of <strong>Americans</strong> -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy<br /><br />And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought <strong>Americans</strong> from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream<br /><br />It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as <strong>Americans</strong><br /><br />For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety <strong>Americans</strong> feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight<br /><br />Let's make it possible for hardworking <strong>Americans</strong> to save for retirement<br /><br />These are <strong>Americans</strong> who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do<br /><br />These are <strong>Americans</strong> who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how<br /><br />And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been <strong>Americans</strong> who refused<br /><br /><strong>Americans</strong> know this<br /><br />Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all <strong>Americans</strong><br /><br />The party that won't make <strong>Americans</strong> choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families<br /><br />Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder <strong>Americans</strong><br /><br /><strong>Americans</strong> everywhere are desperate for leadership</td></tr><tr><td width='20%' valign='top'>Iraqi(25)</td><td width='10%' valign='top'>doc5.txt, doc2.txt</td><td width='70%'>When I came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, I suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of American troops from <strong>Iraqi</strong> soil<br /><br />300,000 <strong>Iraqi</strong> security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet American troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier<br /><br />In just the past three weeks, he has ?

military, financial, diplomatic ? to pressure the <strong>Iraqi</strong> leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control<br /><br />The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the <strong>Iraqi</strong> government ?
